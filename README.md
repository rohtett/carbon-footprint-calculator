# Carbon Compass
About
An app designed to help users become more aware of their impact on the environment by calculating their carbon footprint from recent travels.

## Development Methodology
1. Calculation Methodology: Explain how you calculate the carbon footprint for each type of travel. This could include the formula used, the data sources, and any assumptions made.
2. Input Requirements: Describe the information needed from the user to calculate the carbon footprint. This could include the type of travel (car, bus, train, plane, etc.), the distance travelled, the fuel efficiency of the mode of transport, and the number of passengers.
3. Emission Factors: Provide emission factors for different modes of transportation. These are estimates of how much CO2 is produced per unit of distance travelled or per passenger-mile. You can get these emission factors from government sources, academic studies, or international organizations.
4. Global Warming Potential: Explain the concept of global warming potential (GWP) and how it is used to compare the relative impact of different greenhouse gases. This can help users understand why carbon emissions are being used as a measure of environmental impact.
5. Carbon Offsetting: Educate users on carbon offsetting and how it works. This could include a brief explanation of what carbon offsetting is, how it works, and some of the limitations and criticisms of the practice.
6. Tips for Reducing Carbon Footprint: Provide users with practical tips for reducing their carbon footprint when traveling. This could include suggestions for carpooling, taking public transportation, choosing more fuel-efficient modes of travel, and offsetting carbon emissions.
7. Login and save previous journeys which a user may have taken.
8. Privacy and Data Security: Explain how you will protect user data, including any personally identifiable information that is collected. Provide details on how the data will be stored, who will have access to it, and how it will be used.
9. Support and Feedback: Provide users with information on how they can contact you for support or to provide feedback. This could include an email address, a phone number, or a support forum.

## Future Development
- Compare Carbon Emissions to other users
- The page where it gives you tips to reduce your emissions
- Apple Auth

## Deploying the application
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm install`
#### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. \
